    "light_details": "Monsteras thrive in bright, indirect light. They can tolerate medium light but will grow slower and produce smaller leaves. Avoid direct sunlight, which can scorch the leaves. East or north-facing windows are ideal. More light = more fenestrations (holes) in mature leaves.",
    "humidity": "As tropical plants, Monsteras prefer humidity levels of 60% or higher. They'll adapt to average home humidity (40-50%) but will thrive with a humidifier nearby or regular misting.
